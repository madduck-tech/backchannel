# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Conversationaly** is a privacy-first AI meeting assistant that captures, transcribes, and summarizes meetings entirely on local infrastructure. The supported application is the Tauri desktop app with a Rust core.

1. **Frontend**: Tauri-based desktop application (Rust + Next.js + TypeScript)
2. **Rust Backend**: Tauri commands, audio capture, transcription, storage, and summarization orchestration

### Key Technology Stack
- **Desktop App**: Tauri 2.x (Rust) + Next.js 16 + React 19
- **Audio Processing**: Rust (cpal, professional audio mixing)
- **Transcription**: transcribe.cpp (GGUF on ggml) via the `transcribe-cpp` Rust bindings for ASR models, plus audio-capable LLMs (Gemma 4) through the bundled `llama-helper` sidecar (llama.cpp mtmd) — no external Ollama install
- **App API Surface**: Tauri commands and events
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama (local), Claude, Groq, OpenRouter

Meeting persistence, local transcription, and summary orchestration are handled through the Rust/Tauri core.

### Audio Processing Pipeline (Critical Understanding)

The audio system has **two parallel paths** with different purposes:

```
Raw Audio (Mic + System)
         ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Audio Pipeline Manager                         │
│  (frontend/src-tauri/src/audio/pipeline.rs)                │
└─────────────┬──────────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
              ↓                          ↓
    ┌─────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────┐
    │ Recording Path  │        │ Transcription Path  │
    │ (Pre-mixed)     │        │ (continuous 16kHz)  │
    └─────────────────┘        └─────────────────────┘
              ↓                          ↓
    RecordingSaver.save()      Stream::feed() -> committed text
```

**Key Insight**: The pipeline performs **professional audio mixing** (RMS-based ducking, clipping prevention) for recording, and forwards the same mixed audio continuously (resampled to 16kHz) to a single long-lived transcription stream.

**Live transcription is a hexagon** (`audio/transcription/`). `ports.rs` defines the two boundaries — `Transcriber` (a decoding backend) and `TranscriptSink` (where text and warnings go). `service.rs` is the use case and depends on nothing else, so it is testable without Tauri, a model, or an audio device. `adapters/` holds the outside: `streaming.rs`, `segmented.rs`, `tauri_sink.rs`. `mod.rs` is the composition root that picks a backend.

**Two decode paths, chosen at recording start:**

1. **Streaming** — for streaming-native models. One `transcribe_cpp::Stream` stays open for the whole meeting. Its text splits into `committed` (append-only, never rewritten -> persisted as transcript rows via `transcript-update`) and `tentative` (volatile -> emitted as `transcript-partial`, never saved).
2. **VAD + batch** — speech is segmented and each segment decoded whole. No `transcript-partial` events, and its latency floor is the segment length (`LIVE_MAX_SEGMENT_SAMPLES`, 8s). Two decoders share the loop, behind `enum Decoder`, since segmentation and backlog policy are identical:
   - `Decoder::Local` — `Session::run()` for batch-only catalog families (whisper, canary, qwen3-asr, ...).
   - `Decoder::AudioLlm` — one llama-helper sidecar request per segment for audio-capable LLMs (Gemma 4 E2B/E4B), selected by `transcript_settings.provider = 'builtin-ai'`. Reports no confidence: a chat completion has no token probabilities.

Between 1 and 2, `Capabilities::supports_streaming` on the loaded model decides — read from GGUF metadata, so it cannot drift from what the model can do. The catalog's `streaming` field is display-only (it labels rows before download). The provider is checked first, because an audio LLM has no transcribe.cpp session at all.

Path 2 caps its un-transcribed backlog at 30s and drops the oldest segments past it, so a model slower than real time falls behind by a bounded amount instead of growing for the whole meeting.

**Audio LLM transcription runs in-process, not through Ollama.** `llama-helper` (the sidecar already shipped for summaries) is built with `llama-cpp-2`'s `mtmd` feature, so Gemma 4's audio conformer (`clip.audio.projector_type = gemma4a`) decodes locally. Audio crosses the sidecar's JSON-line protocol as base64 f32 little-endian PCM at 16 kHz. Audio-capable models are marked in `summary_engine::models` by carrying a `Projector` (weights + `mmproj-*-BF16.gguf`), which is also what makes them offerable for transcription — there is no separate flag to drift. BF16 projector specifically: quantized projectors degrade transcripts (llama.cpp#21421). Ollama remains a *summary* provider only.

### Audio Device Modularization

**Context**: The audio system was refactored from a monolithic 1028-line `core.rs` file into focused modules.

```
audio/
├── devices/                    # Device discovery and configuration
│   ├── discovery.rs           # list_audio_devices, trigger_audio_permission

├── recording_manager.rs       # High-level recording coordination
├── recording_commands.rs      # Tauri command interface
└── recording_saver.rs         # Audio file writing
```

**When working on audio features**:
- Device detection issues → `devices/discovery.rs` or `devices/platform/{windows,macos,linux}.rs`
- Microphone/speaker problems → `devices/microphone.rs` or `devices/speakers.rs`
- Audio capture issues → `capture/microphone.rs` or `capture/system.rs`
- Mixing/processing problems → `pipeline.rs`
- Recording workflow → `recording_manager.rs`

### Rust ↔ Frontend Communication (Tauri Architecture)

**Command Pattern** (Frontend → Rust):
```typescript
// Frontend: src/app/page.tsx
await invoke('start_recording', {
  mic_device_name: "Built-in Microphone",
  system_device_name: "BlackHole 2ch",
  meeting_name: "Team Standup"
});
```

```rust
// Rust: src/lib.rs
#[tauri::command]
async fn start_recording<R: Runtime>(
    app: AppHandle<R>,
    mic_device_name: Option<String>,
    system_device_name: Option<String>,
    meeting_name: Option<String>
) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Implementation delegates to audio::recording_commands
}
```

**Event Pattern** (Rust → Frontend):
```rust
// Rust: Emit transcript updates
app.emit("transcript-update", TranscriptUpdate {
    text: "Hello world".to_string(),
    timestamp: chrono::Utc::now(),
    // ...
})?;
```

```typescript
// Frontend: Listen for events
await listen<TranscriptUpdate>('transcript-update', (event) => {
  setTranscripts(prev => [...prev, event.payload]);
});
```

### Transcription Model Management

**Model Storage Locations**:
- **Development**: `frontend/models/`
- **Production (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Conversationaly/models/`
- **Production (Windows)**: `%APPDATA%\Conversationaly\models\`

**Model Loading** (frontend/src-tauri/src/transcribe_engine/engine.rs):
```rust
pub async fn load_model(&self, model_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // Automatically detects GPU capabilities (Metal/CUDA/Vulkan)
    // Falls back to CPU if GPU unavailable
}
```

**GPU Acceleration**:
- **macOS**: Metal + CoreML (automatically enabled)
- **Windows/Linux**: CUDA (NVIDIA), Vulkan (AMD/Intel), or CPU
- Configure via Cargo features: `--features cuda`, `--features vulkan`

## Critical Development Patterns

### 1. Audio Buffer Management

**Ring Buffer Mixing** (pipeline.rs):
- Mic and system audio arrive asynchronously at different rates
- Ring buffer accumulates samples until both streams have aligned windows (50ms)
- Professional mixing applies RMS-based ducking to prevent system audio from drowning out microphone
- Uses `VecDeque` for efficient windowed processing

### 2. Thread Safety and Async Boundaries

**Recording State** (recording_state.rs):
```rust
pub struct RecordingState {
    is_recording: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    audio_sender: Arc<RwLock<Option<mpsc::UnboundedSender<AudioChunk>>>>,
    // ...
}
```

**Key Pattern**: Use `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for shared state across async tasks, `Arc<AtomicBool>` for simple flags.

### 3. Error Handling and Logging

**Performance-Aware Logging** (lib.rs):
```rust
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
macro_rules! perf_debug {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => { log::debug!($($arg)*) };
}

#[cfg(not(debug_assertions))]
macro_rules! perf_debug {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {};  // Zero overhead in release builds
}
```

**Usage**: Use `perf_debug!()` and `perf_trace!()` for hot-path logging that should be eliminated in production.

### 4. Frontend State Management

**Sidebar Context** (components/Sidebar/SidebarProvider.tsx):
- Global state for meetings list, current meeting, recording status
- Communicates with the Rust/Tauri core through Tauri commands and events
- Keeps React state synchronized with native recording, meeting, transcript, and summary state

**Pattern**: Tauri commands update Rust state → Emit events → Frontend listeners update React state → Context propagates to components

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Audio Device Platform

1. Create platform file: `audio/devices/platform/{platform_name}.rs`
2. Implement device enumeration for the platform
3. Add platform-specific configuration in `audio/devices/configuration.rs`
4. Update `audio/devices/platform/mod.rs` to export new platform functions
5. Test with `cargo check` and platform-specific device tests

### Adding a New Tauri Command

1. Define command in `src/lib.rs`:
   ```rust
   #[tauri::command]
   async fn my_command(arg: String) -> Result<String, String> { /* ... */ }
   ```
2. Register in `tauri::Builder`:
   ```rust
   .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
       start_recording,
       my_command,  // Add here
   ])
   ```
3. Call from frontend:
   ```typescript
   const result = await invoke<string>('my_command', { arg: 'value' });
   ```

### Modifying Audio Pipeline Behavior

**Location**: `frontend/src-tauri/src/audio/pipeline.rs`

Key components:
- `AudioMixerRingBuffer`: Manages mic + system audio synchronization
- `ProfessionalAudioMixer`: RMS-based ducking and mixing
- `AudioPipelineManager`: Orchestrates VAD, mixing, and distribution

**Testing Audio Changes**:
```bash
# Enable verbose audio logging
RUST_LOG=app_lib::audio=debug ./clean_run.sh

# Monitor audio metrics in real-time
# Check Developer Console in the app (Cmd+Shift+I on macOS)
```

### Tauri Backend Development

Add new frontend-facing behavior through Tauri commands/events and the existing Rust services under `frontend/src-tauri/src`.

## Testing and Debugging

### Frontend Debugging

**Enable Rust Logging**:
```bash
# macOS
RUST_LOG=debug ./clean_run.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:RUST_LOG="debug"; ./clean_run_windows.bat
```

**Developer Tools**:
- Open DevTools: `Cmd+Shift+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows)
- Console Toggle: Built into app UI (console icon)
- View Rust logs: Check terminal output

### Audio Pipeline Debugging

**Key Metrics** (emitted by pipeline):
- Buffer sizes (mic/system)
- Mixing window count
- VAD detection rate
- Dropped chunk warnings

**Monitor via Developer Console**: The app includes real-time metrics display when recording.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS
- **Audio Capture**: Uses ScreenCaptureKit for system audio (macOS 13+)
- **GPU**: Metal + CoreML automatically enabled
- **Permissions**: Requires microphone + screen recording permissions
- **System Audio**: Requires virtual audio device (BlackHole) for system capture

### Windows
- **Audio Capture**: Uses WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API)
- **GPU**: CUDA (NVIDIA) or Vulkan (AMD/Intel) via Cargo features
- **Build Tools**: Requires Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ workload
- **System Audio**: Uses WASAPI loopback for system capture

### Linux
- **Audio Capture**: ALSA/PulseAudio
- **GPU**: CUDA (NVIDIA) or Vulkan via Cargo features
- **Dependencies**: Requires cmake, llvm, libomp

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### Audio Processing
- Use `perf_debug!()` / `perf_trace!()` for hot-path logging (zero cost in release)
- Batch audio metrics using `AudioMetricsBatcher` (pipeline.rs)
- Pre-allocate buffers with `AudioBufferPool` (buffer_pool.rs)
- Streaming models are real-time-native; measured RTF ~0.06 on M1 Max (Metal)

### Transcription
- **Model Selection**: the catalog covers every family transcribe.cpp supports — 85 rows across 16 families (see `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL_CATALOG` in config.rs). It is **generated**: edit `frontend/src-tauri/scripts/gen_model_catalog.py` and re-run it, never the array.
  - Default: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-q8` — lowest WER (1.94%) that still keeps up live; batch-only, so live text arrives in ~8s segments with no partials, across 25 European locales
  - `nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-q8` is the streaming-native alternative: word-by-word live text and 32 locales incl. CJK/Arabic/Hindi, at 3.06% WER
  - Batch-only families are selectable for live recording too, via the VAD + batch path above
  - Excluded on purpose: `diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1` (no text output), `medasr` (gated upstream), `voxtral-small-24b-2507` (too large)
  - Low-end machines: `moonshine-streaming-{small,tiny}` (English only)
- **GPU Acceleration**: Metal on macOS by default; CUDA/Vulkan/ROCm via Cargo features

### Frontend Performance
- React state updates batched via Sidebar context
- Transcript rendering virtualized for large meetings
- Audio level monitoring throttled to 60fps

## Important Constraints and Gotchas

1. **Audio Chunk Size**: Pipeline expects consistent 48kHz sample rate. Resampling happens at capture time.

2. **Platform Audio Quirks**:
   - macOS: ScreenCaptureKit requires macOS 13+, needs screen recording permission
   - Windows: WASAPI exclusive mode can conflict with other apps
   - System audio requires virtual device (BlackHole on macOS, WASAPI loopback on Windows)

3. **Model Loading**: Models are loaded once and cached. transcribe.cpp allows at most ONE in-flight compute per `Model` — a batch `run()` during an active stream fails with `Error::Busy`. This is why the VAD + batch live path decodes segments through a single serialized worker, and why `transcribe_batch` (import/retranscription) cannot run during a recording.

   The sidecar has the same constraint for a different reason: one process, one loaded model. `SidecarManager::ensure_running` therefore **refuses to switch models while recording** — a summary on a different model mid-meeting would respawn the sidecar and kill the live transcription with it. A summary on the *same* model reuses the loaded weights, which is why `gemma4:e2b` — the smaller tier, and what onboarding downloads — is the default for both jobs.

4. **File Paths**: Use Tauri's path APIs (`downloadDir`, etc.) for cross-platform compatibility. Never hardcode paths.

5. **Audio Permissions**: Request permissions early. macOS requires both microphone AND screen recording for system audio.

6. **No text injection into other applications without a verified caret anchor**: No injection code exists today. This is a rule for whoever builds it, not a description of current behavior.

   - Never write a whole field. FluidVoice, the macOS dictation app studied for this, has Accessibility rungs that replace the target's entire `kAXValue`, and the target is sometimes picked by a hierarchy walk rather than by focus. The field it destroys need not be the one the user is typing in.
   - Those destructive rungs are reached precisely when `kAXValue` / `kAXSelectedTextRange` are unreadable: Electron apps, web views, terminals. For a desktop dictation tool that is the majority case, not the tail.
   - One occurrence is unbounded loss of someone else's document, and we leave no undo entry behind for them to recover it.
   - A verified caret anchor — insert, then read back what landed and where — is a prerequisite that gates the feature. It is not a follow-up.
   - Do not add `enigo`, `rdev`, or a CGEventTap. Synthesizing keystrokes gives no read-back, so it cannot satisfy the anchor requirement, and it needs a blanket Accessibility grant that turns every keystroke the user types into something the app can see.

## Repository-Specific Conventions

- **Logging Format**: Rust logs should include enough module context to diagnose app behavior
- **Error Handling**: Rust uses `anyhow::Result`, frontend uses try-catch with user-friendly messages
- **Naming**: Audio devices use "microphone" and "system" consistently (not "input"/"output")
- **Git Branches**:
  - `main`: Stable releases
  - `fix/*`: Bug fixes
  - `enhance/*`: Feature enhancements
