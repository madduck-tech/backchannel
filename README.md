## Introduction

Conversationaly is a desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux) that captures your microphone and system audio, transcribes the meeting as it happens, and generates a summary. Transcription models and the summary LLM both run locally by default — nothing is sent anywhere. Cloud providers are available if you want them, but they are opt-in, per-feature.

It is a fork of [Meetily](https://github.com/Zackriya-Solutions/meeting-minutes), rebuilt around [transcribe.cpp](https://github.com/handy-computer/transcribe.cpp) and a bundled llama.cpp sidecar. It is fully free — there is no paid tier, no license key, no telemetry.

## Features

- **Local transcription** — 85 models across 16 families (Whisper, Parakeet, Nemotron, Canary, Voxtral, Qwen3-ASR, SenseVoice, Moonshine, GigaAM, …), downloaded on demand. Default: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-q8` (1.94% WER, 25 European locales); `nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-q8` for word-by-word live text across 32 locales.
- **Live transcript** — streaming-native models transcribe continuously as you speak; batch-only models are segmented by voice activity and still work live.
- **Built-in AI, no Ollama required** — a bundled `llama-helper` sidecar runs Gemma 4 locally for summaries, and can also transcribe directly as an audio LLM.
- **Bring your own LLM** — summaries via Built-in AI, Ollama, Claude, Groq, OpenRouter, OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Optional cloud STT** — Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Groq, or OpenAI, if you prefer a hosted transcriber.
- **Professional audio mixing** — microphone and system audio captured together with RMS-based ducking and clipping prevention.
- **Import & enhance** `Beta` — transcribe existing audio files, or re-transcribe a past meeting with a different model or language.
- **Summary templates** — pick or write the structure your summaries follow, and set the summary language independently of the spoken one.
- **GPU acceleration** — Metal on Apple Silicon, CUDA (NVIDIA), Vulkan (AMD/Intel), ROCm (AMD on Linux).
- **Local storage** — meetings, transcripts, and models live in a SQLite database and a model directory on your disk.

## Installation

Prebuilt installers (macOS `.dmg`, Windows `.exe`, Linux `.deb`/`.rpm`/`.AppImage`) are published on the [Releases page](https://github.com/bykof/conversationaly/releases) when a version is tagged.

### Build from source

Requires Rust, Node.js, pnpm, and cmake. See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for per-platform prerequisites.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bykof/conversationaly
cd conversationaly/frontend
pnpm install

# macOS
./clean_build.sh

# Linux (auto-detects GPU backend)
./build-gpu.sh

# Windows
clean_build_windows.bat
```

Linux specifics: [docs/building_in_linux.md](docs/building_in_linux.md).

### Permissions

- **macOS** — microphone, plus screen recording for system audio (ScreenCaptureKit, macOS 13+).
- **Windows** — microphone; system audio uses WASAPI loopback.

## How It Works

On first launch, onboarding downloads one transcription model and one Gemma 4 tier. From then on:

1. Microphone and system audio are captured, mixed, and written to a recording.
2. The same mixed audio is resampled to 16 kHz and fed to the transcription engine, which emits transcript lines as the meeting runs.
3. When you ask for a summary, the transcript goes to whichever LLM provider you configured — the local sidecar by default.

![A finished meeting: the transcript on the left, the generated summary on the right](docs/imgs/meeting_transcription_summary.png)

Everything above is a local process. Cloud STT and cloud summary providers are the only paths that leave your machine, and only when you select one and supply a key.

## System Architecture

A single Tauri application: a Rust core (audio capture, transcription, storage, summary orchestration) and a Next.js frontend, communicating over Tauri commands and events. There is no separate server to run.

Details: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## For Developers

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install

./clean_run.sh              # macOS: build and run (info logging)
./clean_run.sh debug        # verbose logging
clean_run_windows.bat       # Windows
./dev-gpu.sh                # Linux

pnpm run tauri:dev          # plain dev mode
pnpm run tauri:dev:metal    # force a specific GPU backend
pnpm run tauri:dev:cuda
pnpm run tauri:dev:vulkan
pnpm run tauri:dev:cpu
```
