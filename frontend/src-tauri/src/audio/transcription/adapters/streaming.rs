// Driving adapter for models that stream, which is the preferred path: one
// transcribe.cpp Stream stays open for the whole meeting and audio is fed to it
// continuously, so the model keeps its context across pauses.
//
// The split that makes this work is transcribe.cpp's own:
//   - `committed` text is append-only and never rewritten -> a TranscriptChunk,
//     which is exactly what the transcript table assumes.
//   - `tentative` text is the volatile suffix -> shown greyed, never saved.
// Because committed text can only grow, nothing downstream needs revision or
// reconciliation logic.
