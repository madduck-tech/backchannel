// audio/transcription/adapters/bench_sink.rs
//
// A measuring decorator on the driven side of the hexagon.
//
// The question it exists to answer is "how far behind the speaker is the
// transcript?", and nothing else in the app can answer it. A decoder knows how
// long its own decode took; a sink knows what text arrived. Only the pair of
// (wall clock, audio position) captured at the instant text is committed gives
// the lag a user actually experiences.
//
// A decorator rather than a macro sprinkled through the adapters, because every
// backend commits through a `TranscriptSink`. Wrapping the sink at the two
// composition points in `transcription/mod.rs` therefore instruments the
// streaming path, the local batch path and the sidecar audio-LLM path at once,
// and none of the three adapters has to know that measurement exists.
