// audio/dictation_probe.rs
//
// A measurement, not a feature. This is not dictation and must not grow into
// it: it exists to produce the one number nobody in this repo has, and then to
// be deleted or kept as an instrument.
//
// ## The open question
//
// Decode is the cheap half. At RTF ~0.06 a five-second utterance finalizes in
// ~300ms on an already-loaded model, and Wave 1's `BENCH stream:` line already
// reports that from real meetings. Capture *start* is the unknown. Reading the
// code it looks like 300-800ms — device resolution, cpal stream construction, a
// 50ms mixing window in the pipeline and a 512-sample resampler fill — but that
// is an estimate assembled from reading, not a measurement, and the parts of it
// that dominate (Core Audio handing over a Bluetooth input) are exactly the
// parts source cannot tell you.
//
// ## EXIT CRITERION — written before the body, and before any number existed
//
//   If first-chunk exceeds ~250 ms on a machine with Bluetooth audio paired,
//   dictation requires a prewarmed capture path — FluidVoice spent ~1,750 lines
//   on theirs — and the bet is XXL, not XL.
//
// Stated in advance because that is the only way it decides anything. A
// threshold argued for after seeing the result is not a threshold, it is a
// rationalisation with a number in it, and 250ms is close enough to the
// estimate's floor that either side of it is genuinely reachable.
//
// ## How a human runs it
//
// Only compiled in debug builds (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` covers this module,
// the command, and its `generate_handler!` entry), so it cannot ship. Start the
// app with `./clean_run.sh`, load a *streaming* transcription model, then from
// the devtools console (Cmd+Shift+I):
//
//     await __TAURI__.core.invoke('dictation_probe')
//
// and speak a short phrase immediately. The returned string and the
// `BENCH dictation_probe:` line in the log carry the same numbers. Run it once
// with a Bluetooth headset as the default input and once with the built-in mic;
// the gap between those two is the actual finding.
//
// ## What it deliberately does not do
//
// No hotkey, no UI, no text injection, no new dependency, no new model, and no
// prewarming — prewarming is the thing being *costed*, and cpal cannot express
// prepare-without-start anyway. It also does not touch `IS_RECORDING` or the
// global `RECORDING_MANAGER`: it builds its own `RecordingManager`, drops it on
// every exit path, and refuses to run at all while a meeting is recording.
//
// That it can reuse `StreamingTranscriber` and `service::run` unmodified, with a
// throwaway `Vec`-collecting sink, is the hexagon's port claim being cashed
// rather than asserted. Nothing in `audio/transcription/` changed for this.
